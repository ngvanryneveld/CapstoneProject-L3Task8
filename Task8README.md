# Poised Project Database
This program works on previous projects but instead of using OOP, it implements the use of databases through access to MySQL.

The user of the program will select whichever option from the menu and the corresponding action will happen, many of these actions will guide the user to put inputs in various positions.

The user can edit any variable for a project, client, contractor or architect. 
The user can generate reports and can display out appropriate information regarding what the user is looking for.

The access to MySQL connection is made and allows the database to be changed and updated from the program. 
This means that the information is stored indefinitely and the database can be accessed from another computer as long as access is given.
